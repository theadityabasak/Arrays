# Arrays in C++
An array in C++ is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable, which can be efficiently accessed using an index. 
Properties : -An Array is a collection of data of the same data type, stored at a contiguous memory location. -Indexing of an array starts from 0. It means the first element is stored at the 0th index, the second at 1st, and so on. -Elements of an array can be accessed using their indices. -Once an array is declared its size remains constant throughout the program. -An array can have multiple dimensions. -The size of the array in bytes can be determined by the sizeof operator using which we can also find the number of elements in the array. -We can find the size of the type of elements stored in an array by subtracting adjacent addresses.

Initializing Arrays: Arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration. int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Array initialized with values

# Strings in C++
Strings are sequences of characters and are used to store text. In C++, the string class is defined in the <string> header file. There are two types of strings in C++ :

C style Strings
std : : strings
